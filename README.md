# IBM-Data-Science-Course-10-Final-Project
This file contains all the completed projects in course 10 for each module in the final presentation.
This capstone project covers all skills explored in the IBM Data Science Coursera course. In this particular project, we take on the role of a data scientist working at a company Space Y that is competing against SpaceX. SpaceX is known for launching cost-efficient rockets, specifically the F9 launcher, and obtains successful launching outcomes. The goal is to use public data from SpaceX to gather information on the F9 launcher and SpaceX launch sites. Using this info, a variety of data collection and manipulation skills will be used to obtain a method in which a successful launching outcome during the first stage of Space Y's rocket launch can be achieved. The following skills in this project are explored:

- Data Collection With API
- Data Collection With Web Scraping
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Analysis Using SQL (Includes EDA with visualization as well)
- Interactive Visual Analytics With Folium
- Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash
- Machine Learning Prediction (Using LR, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree models)
